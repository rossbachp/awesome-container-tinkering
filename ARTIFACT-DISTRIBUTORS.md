are up-to-date, secure, and optimized for use in various environments.  Each Official Image undergoes a thorough review process
to meet Docker's standards for best practices, including clear documentation, minimal size, and efficient design.
This ensures that developers have access to reliable and consistent images for their applications.

The Official Images cover a broad spectrum of use cases, from programming languages and databases to web servers
and operating system bases. Examples include images for Python, Node.js, MySQL, NGINX, and Ubuntu.
These images serve as trusted starting points for building and deploying containerized applications, reducing the need for developers
to create images from scratch. Docker continuously enhances the security and transparency of Official Images by implementing measures
such as automated builds, vulnerability scanning, and providing detailed image metadata. This commitment helps maintain the integrity
and trustworthiness of the images available to the community.

## Linuxserver.io

[LinuxServer.io](https://www.linuxserver.io) is a global collective of enthusiasts dedicated to building and maintaining
a comprehensive suite of Docker images, emphasizing Free and Open Source Software principles. Their primary objective is
to deliver user-friendly, standardized Docker images accompanied by clear documentation.  Their images are constructed
from a uniquely curated base, utilizing s6-overlay to ensure high extensibility and uniformity across applications.
This approach optimizes bandwidth and storage by sharing base layers among images. To keep their images current,
LinuxServer.io has implemented an automated build pipeline that rebuilds images in response to upstream application
or dependency updates. This ensures users have access to the latest versions, with a tagging system that clearly indicates
the application version contained in each build. Comprehensive setup guides are available for all images, accessible on GitHub
or their dedicated documentation space. Additional guides and articles can be found on their blog Support
is provided through their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YWrKVTn) and [Discourse forum](https://discourse.linuxserver.io/),
fostering a community where both team members and users can assist with any issues.

## Dev Containers

[Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/) (Development Containers) are portable, consistent, and isolated development environments defined using
container technologies like Docker. They simplify the setup of development environments by providing all necessary
dependencies, tools, and configurations in a predefined container. Typically used with Visual Studio Code and its
Dev Containers extension, they enable developers to work in a consistent environment across different systems.

Dev Containers are defined in a .devcontainer folder containing configuration files like devcontainer.json, Dockerfiles,
or Docker Compose files, allowing integration with IDEs and remote development workflows.

## "Distroless" Container Images

[Distroless Container Images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) is an open-source project from GoogleContainerTools
that provides minimal container base images without a traditional package manager or shell. These images are focused solely on the
application’s runtime requirements, enhancing security, performance, and size optimization. Distroless images integrate seamlessly with tools like Docker and Kubernetes, promoting better security practices 
in containerized applications.

## Nixery

[Nixery](https://nixery.dev) is an on-demand container image registry that dynamically generates Docker images based
on specified Nix packages. By appending package names to the Nixery URL, users can create custom images containing those packages.
For example, pulling nixery.dev/shell/git/htop provides an image with both Git and htop installed.
This approach streamlines workflows by eliminating the need to pre-build and store numerous container images.
NixOS offers robust support for containerization through native systemd-nspawn containers and integration with Docker.
Native NixOS containers are managed declaratively using the containers directive, allowing users to define container
configurations within the NixOS system configuration. This method ensures consistency and reproducibility across container deployments.

For Docker integration, NixOS provides options to enable and configure the Docker service declaratively.
By setting virtualisation.docker.enable = true; in the NixOS configuration, users can install and manage Docker.
Additional settings, such as specifying the storage driver or enabling rootless mode, can be customized
to suit specific requirements. These tools and configurations empower NixOS users to efficiently manage
containerized environments, leveraging the strengths of the Nix package manager for reproducibility and consistency.
