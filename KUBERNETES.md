# Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust and scalable solution for managing applications in a microservices architecture, helping users manage complex applications across clusters of machines. Kubernetes handles tasks such as load balancing, service discovery, automated rollouts, self-healing (e.g., restarting failed containers), and scaling based on demand. With its declarative configuration model, Kubernetes ensures that the desired state of the system is maintained. It is widely used in both cloud and on-premises environments for building cloud-native applications and is supported by a large ecosystem of tools and services.
