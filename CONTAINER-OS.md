# Container OS

## Talos Linux - The Kubernetes Operating System

[Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev) is a purpose-built Linux distribution designed specifically for Kubernetes. It is secure, immutable, and minimal by design.

Key features include:

* __Broad Platform Support__: Compatible with cloud platforms, bare metal, and virtualization environments.
* __API-Driven Management__: System administration is conducted entirely via API, eliminating the need for SSH, shell access, or console interactions.
* __Production-Grade Reliability__: Talos powers some of the largest Kubernetes clusters worldwide.
* __Open Source__: Developed and maintained by the team at Sidero Labs, Talos is available for community use and contribution.

Talos Linux sets a new standard for simplicity, security, and scalability in Kubernetes environments.
